Bug 1: Date of Birth Loop / Failure to Parse Identity
Calls: 20260224-224524_CA5c465cab98e9cb987f3cba0811d6dd85.txt
       20260224-230930_CAbb4118ba9a4cd6b626736a25f044b0da.txt

Details:
The agent repeatedly asks for “data birth” even after the user provides it multiple times. 
In one call, the agent continues asking for the DOB in slightly different broken phrasings 
("month day in here", "specific numbers for you data birth") without progressing.

Why This Is a Problem:
This creates a dead-end loop where the user cannot move forward. Identity verification 
is a core workflow, and failure to parse common DOB formats (spoken month/day/year, 
numeric format, ISO format) makes the system unusable.

----------------------------------------
Bug 2: Cannot Create New Patient Accounts
Calls: 20260224-231412_CA24b35b4577e23a6ddddbeb0c85b42908.txt
       20260224-223015_CAeeae2fb1f4db63b868aa18abe5040706.txt

Details:
When a user is not found in the system, the agent states it cannot create a new 
patient account and cannot proceed. It attempts escalation, which is unavailable.

Why This Is a Problem:
Creating a new patient is a core clinic workflow. Blocking appointment scheduling for 
new patients limits the real-world usability.

----------------------------------------
Bug 3: Medication Refill Workflow Failure
Calls: 20260224-231412_CA24b35b4577e23a6ddddbeb0c85b42908.txt
       20260224-223605_CA3402012b66aa618bf489de724b819dea.txt

Details:
When asking for medication refills including a list of medications, the agent 
fails to complete the workflow due to inability to access records. It does not 
offer structured fallback steps.

Why This Is a Problem:
Medication refill handling is safety-critical. The system does not provide 
clear next steps or confirmation that the request is logged.

----------------------------------------
Bug 4: Language Consistency Failure (Spanish Call)
Call: 20260224-223605_CA3402012b66aa618bf489de724b819dea.txt

Details:
The conversation begins in Spanish, then the agent switches back to English 
mid-conversation. Spanish responses are grammatically incorrect and repetitive 
(“Hola, ¿en qué puedo ayudar y yo voy?” repeated multiple times). 

Why This Is a Problem:
Language instability creates confusion. In healthcare settings, 
clear multilingual support is critical. This was probably the worst bug found.

----------------------------------------
Bug 5: Incorrect Provider Information / Gender Confusion
Call: 20260224-215414_CA3c50e26a84bd377334b5cba62241710d.txt

Details:
The agent describes “Dr. Judy Houser” using male pronouns, 
then inconsistently references provider names (Doody House / Doogie Houser / Brecker / Bricker).

Why This Is a Problem:
Inconsistent provider identity creates confusion and reduces trust. 
Accurate representation of clinicians is essential in healthcare systems.

----------------------------------------
Bug 6: Identity Lookup Workflow
Call: 20260224-220113_CAf487a41444ed82675fef901bb0013efd.txt

Details:
User attempts alternative lookup (email). Agent refuses and loops back to 
reconfirm name and DOB, then fails to proceed.

Why This Is a Problem:
System lacks flexible identity verification options (email, alternate identifiers). 
When lookup fails, no structured recovery path is provided.

----------------------------------------
Bug 7: Time Availability Logic Inconsistency
Call: 20260224-213052_CAc26ced5f92427a60b70f4f57e8671969.txt

Details:
Agent initially states no openings in next week and early March, 
then suddenly provides March 5th availability.

Why This Is a Problem:
Inconsistent availability logic reduces reliability and may indicate 
backend scheduling logic instability.
